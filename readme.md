### HanoiTowers in Unity (ES)

An interactive HanoiTowers game school project, made in 2 days and also my first work on 3D.

'Builds' and 'Library' folders are not included as they are very storage-expensive and are not mandatory to start editing the project in unity.
I'll edit this readme when an online demo is available.

Made with LTS 2020.3.26f1 version.

#### Changelog:

##### v1:
- Initial functional version.

#### v1.1:
- Game no longer stops working properly when winning a first play (player is able to spawn disks again).
- Lights trigger when you win a play to indicate victory.
